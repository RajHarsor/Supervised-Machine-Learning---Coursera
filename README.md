# Supervised-Machine-Learning 

This repository documents the coursework that I went through during my time in the Oldenburg Lab using the Supervised Machine Learning Course found on Coursera. The course was recommended to me by Ian when I was sick with COVID and I set out to complete this course along with the labs. The course is intended to be 3 weeks in length.

## Dates and Difficulty

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Start Date:** 12/1/2022

**End Date:** 1/1/2023

## Rationale for doing the Course

When we do start getting data, we will be using machine learning via Tensorflow for behavioral applications and possibly computational neuroscience applications. Knowing the basics of machine learning might be helpful in understanding data and how to approach it.

## My Review

Overall, I found this course informative and easy to understand. The instructor goes slow and makes you understand the content, which is very nice, and each point is hammered multiple times. I do also like the labs (even though they are locked behind a paywall on Coursera, you can easily find them on Github or in this repositroy). The labs help solidify the content and really show you the techniques that are talked about in the video. The downside of the labs though is that while they show off the content, they don't teach you how to code the specific elements and the logic behind the coding which I believe would have really made the course worth it. Despite this being a good course though I don't think (as of right now) that the course will be the most useful in terms of things we do in the lab but I can see it being a good introduction overall to Machine Learning which could be helpful to some. I don't recommend doing this course as while I can't say it's a complete waste of time, it seemed like enough of a waste of time to justify not recommending it.
